This project is realted to BOD in river water.The data is collected from kaggle.THe dataset consist of 147 observations and 9 variables.All the predictors explain the various features of the BOd in River Water, the data frame consists of one output variable 'Target'. Data cleaning steps those columns have null or missing values remove it. Various plots such as scatter plots, violin plots, box plots, bar graphs etc. are plotted to explore the relationships between the output variable 'Target' and predictors.ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor are used to explore the positive and negative coefficients that influence the target. The concept of Cross Validation is used to extract the best RMSE (Root mean squared error) score to analyse the best algorithm of all the algorithms applied.
